# MusicControlWidget
App that can detect the Bluetooth A2DP connection and disconnection as well as sends a broadcast about the Bluetooth device name for apps like KWGT to display the name. This is also an auto-start app, so you don't have to launch it every time.

## To eneable auto start:
Go to Phone settings -> Accessibility -> MusicControlWidget -> Turn the toggle on, done

* I really do have to work on UI *
